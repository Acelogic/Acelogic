<!--ABOUT ME CODE-->
**🌱 About myself**<br>

Hey! 👋 I’m Miguel Cruz, a 💻 software engineer focused on desktop and mobile operating systems, with a strong emphasis on security.
I’ve been working in this space since 2011, starting with iOS 5 and Android Gingerbread. Over the years, I’ve also gained experience in full-stack web development and embedded systems.
I contribute to open-source projects such as QEMU, Virtio, the Linux Kernel, and NewPipe, and I’ve been involved in robotics competitions and startup incubators since 2014.
Since 2019, I’ve been working with AI and transformers, starting with GPT-2. I’ve also been building financial projects, including options trading systems, financial modeling, and custom backtesting engines.
I’m always open to new challenges and collaborations—feel free to reach out if you’d like to build something together.
